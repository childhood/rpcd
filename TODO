 * change naming convention of "global.so"
   * start with e.g. '=' to make it first in asn_ls()
   * let for more than one global module per directory - cool hook for quick&dirty hacking in bash
 * "superglobal" modules for whole rpcd instance?
 * documentation

 * add identity info to request, pass to modules
   * HTTP headers
   * JSON-RPC query parameters
   * SCGI variables from HTTP server
 * add authentication layer (fetch group if available)
   * always-auth (for HTTP servers - CGI, SCGI, etc)
   * Flatconf
   * system (shadow)
 * simple authorization scheme: require auth-user

 * flatconf/:
   * move I/O format selection to flatconf - needed for AAA config which is dependent on this
   * authentication config
   * authorization config
   * dir.fc: let for parameter passing to modules
   * limit.fc: remove

 * a facility like DBUS to communicate with other instances (processes) of rpcd (possibly serving the same app)
   * we need a facility like mutex to synchronize concurrent access eg. to Flatconfs /etc/fc
   * see sem_overview(7) (remember about ipcs -l)
 * interface to change debugging levels on-the-fly
   * usage scenario: admin needs to "tcpdump" queries and replies
   * usage scenario: admin wants to get memory usage info to set an rlimit on rpcd
