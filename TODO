 * write some apps, polish the API
 * documentation

--------------------------------

 * SCGI interface
 * AAA
   * pass SCGI auth info
   * system auth (shadow)
 * write module parameter passing code (to env)
 * superglobal modules for rpcd extensions (like custom AAA)
 * a facility like DBUS to communicate with other instances (processes) of rpcd (possibly serving the same app)
   * we need a facility like mutex to synchronize concurrent access eg. to Flatconfs /etc/fc
   * see sem_overview(7) (remember about ipcs -l)
 * interface to change debugging levels on-the-fly
   * usage scenario: admin needs to "tcpdump" queries and replies
   * usage scenario: admin wants to get memory usage info to set an rlimit on rpcd
